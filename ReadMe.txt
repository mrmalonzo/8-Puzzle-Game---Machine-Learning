-The programming language used is still Python

-There was only one big problem that I encountered during the exer. It isn't the implementation of the algorithm, but rather the file browsing of puzzle.in(s). It turns out that pygame has no file input function and that I needed to resort to other GUIs for python for my program to have that function

-The problem were resolved by me sending Mam Kat a message for an idea on how to solve it. She said that I should use tkinter for that specific function. And I did just that. Voila, problem solved by using tkinter in my pygame.

-Learned how to implement an A* informed search algorithm, how to implement tkinter together with my pygame, and finally, learned the basics of overleaf.
